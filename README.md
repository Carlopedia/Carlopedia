Hi there 👋,

Carlopedia Here!

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Ed Leadership at the University of Florida. Go Gators 🐊!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on three projects: FL Civics Bills (NLP and SNA), Legal Issues and the Superintendency (Case Study), NAEP Civics (MRP), FL Curriculum Gag Orders (Legal Analysis), School Safety Dashboard (FLDOE and FLDOJ Grant), and Exclusionary Discipline (OLS).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Stata, Python, and Git all at the same time :(

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Ed Policy Research specifically in the K12 setting. Open to studies on Equity and Empowerment, School Safety and Discipline, FL and/or US Civics Education.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid soccer fan ⚽️ (Argentina/Barca/InterMiami)
